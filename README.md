# Delivery Fee Calculation Service

This is my entry for the Wolt engineering internship 2024. I only saw the ad on Monday, so please go soft on me :P

## Running the project

Navigate to the project directory and run

```bash
npm install
```

then run

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Running Tests

To run the tests, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You will also need Jest, a JavaScript testing framework. If you haven't installed Jest yet, you can do so by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest
```
